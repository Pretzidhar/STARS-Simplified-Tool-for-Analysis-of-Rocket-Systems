# STARS-Simplified-Tool-for-Analysis-of-Rocket-Systems
The liquid rocket engine system design and analysis program has been developed for preliminary design process. The program performs system analysis according to input variables and requirements. It also seeks design variables. Simple GUI was constructed for user convenience. Moreover, visualized design output can be figured in three-dimensional model. The results are expected to be applied to analysis and selection of propulsion system, which is a part of preliminary design of launch vehicle.
